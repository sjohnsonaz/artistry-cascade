# Artistry Cascade

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sjohnsonaz/cascade-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sjohnsonaz/cascade-components) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cascade-components.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cascade-components)

A powerful component library for Cascade.  All components have been designed with Cascade in mind, reducing re-renders and other JavaScript activity.

Furthermore, the components are designed to work seamlessly together.  They are built using a simple, powerful, and configurable stylesheet.  Most animation is style based, again reducing JavaScript activity.

The API is focused on consistency, and ease of use.
